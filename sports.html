<p><span class="glowing-text">I chose Ohio State football as my favorite sports team because it is the team
I enjoy watching the most.  I have been a fan since I was a baby because my dad went to Ohio State
and I have been to games with him.  Growing up in Columbus Ohio State football is what everyone looks
forward to in the fall.  I myself love playing football with my friends.  It helps that Ohio State
is one of the best teams in the country and are always competing for a championship.  </span>
